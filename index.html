                <p>The Donnelly Company ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and protect your information when you use Nuance Notes (the "App"). The App allows users to record meeting notes by voice, convert them to text, and send the notes to an email address of their choice. We do not store or share your data with third parties, except as described in this policy.</p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>The App collects the following types of information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Voice Recordings and Text Data:</strong> When you use the App, you may record meeting notes by voice, which are converted to text within the App. These recordings and the resulting text are processed locally on your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Email Information:</strong> The App allows you to send the converted text notes to an email address of your choice using your device's email client. You provide the recipient's email address and use your own email account to send the notes.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Stored Data:</strong> We do not collect, store, or retain your voice recordings, text notes, or email information on our servers or systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="policy-section">
                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>The information processed by the App is used solely to provide its core functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Voice-to-Text Conversion:</strong> Your voice recordings are converted to text locally on your device to create meeting notes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Email Functionality:</strong> The App interfaces with your device's email client to allow you to send the text notes to an email address you specify.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not use your information for any other purpose, such as analytics, marketing, or profiling.</p>

                <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> We do not store your voice recordings, text notes, or email information on our servers or any other systems. All data processing occurs locally on your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporary Processing:</strong> Any data processed during voice-to-text conversion or email preparation is temporarily handled on your device and is deleted from the App once the action is complete (e.g., after the email is sent or the session ends).</li>
                    <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You have full control over the data you input into the App, and it is not retained by us after you close the App or complete the email action.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your voice recordings, text notes, or email information with any third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Email Transmission:</strong> When you choose to send notes via email, the email is sent through your device's email client to the recipient's email address. This process is controlled by you and uses your email service provider, which may have its own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing your email provider's privacy policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid request from a governmental authority, such as a court order or subpoena.</li>

                <p>The App does not integrate with third-party services for data collection, analytics, or advertising. The only third-party service involved is your email client, which is used to send notes at your discretion. We do not control or access your email account or its contents.</p>
