            OopsIForgotInc ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application, <strong>RemindMeBro</strong> ("the App"), collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use the App on your iOS device. This policy applies to the RemindMeBro app available on the Apple App Store.

                <li><strong>Other Information:</strong> Company names, codes, notes, and location data associated with where you met a person or learned a code or number.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All data entered into the App is processed and stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store this data on our servers or share it with any third parties.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>The data you enter into RemindMeBro is used solely to provide the App's core functionality, which includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allowing you to record and organize information about people, companies, codes, or numbers, along with associated notes and location data.</li>
                <li>Displaying this information to you within the App for your reference.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, we do not access or use this data for any other purpose, such as analytics, advertising, or personalization beyond the App's functionality.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data you enter into RemindMeBro is stored locally on your iOS device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Data remains on your device until you choose to delete it through the App or uninstall the App. Uninstalling RemindMeBro will remove all App-related data from your device, as we do not retain any copies of your data.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any data entered into RemindMeBro with third parties, as all data remains on your device. The App does not integrate with third-party services (e.g., analytics tools, advertising networks, or social media platforms) that would access or process your data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. User Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>As all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your information. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access and Edit:</strong> View and modify your data directly within the App at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete specific entries or all data by using the App's delete functionality or by uninstalling the App, which removes all data stored by RemindMeBro from your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Revoking Consent:</strong> Since the App does not transmit data or require ongoing consent for data collection beyond its core functionality, no additional consent revocation is needed. You can stop using the App at any time to cease data input.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have questions about managing your data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:oopsiforgotinc@gmail.com">oopsiforgotinc@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We prioritize the security of your data. Since all data is stored locally on your iOS device, it is protected by the security features of your device, such as encryption, passcodes, Face ID, or Touch ID, as provided by Apple. We do not access or control this data, and no additional server-side security measures are applicable, as no data is transmitted to or stored by OopsIForgotInc.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>RemindMeBro does not use third-party services, SDKs, or APIs that collect or process user data. All functionality is self-contained within the App.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Compliance with Laws</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy complies with Apple's App Store Review Guidelines and applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</strong> If you are in the European Union, note that no personal data is transmitted to us, so GDPR obligations related to data processing do not apply. All data remains on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</strong> As no personal data is collected or shared by us, CCPA data sale or sharing provisions do not apply.</li>
                <li><strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</strong> The App is not directed at users under 13 years of age. If you believe a child under 13 has used the App, please contact us, and we will provide guidance on deleting data from the device.</li>

            <h2>9. Privacy Policy for App Store Connect</h2>
            <p>As required by Apple's App Store Review Guidelines, we confirm:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The App collects names, company names, codes, notes, and location data, all of which are stored locally on your device and not linked to your identity by OopsIForgotInc.</li>
