        <h1>Privacy Policy for RemindMeBro</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 12, 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>RemindMeBro is a mobile application developed by Oopsiforgot, Inc ("we," "us," or "our"). The app allows users to set reminders for people's names based on the location where they meet them. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of RemindMeBro. Since RemindMeBro does not collect, store, or share personal data beyond what is stored locally on your device, this policy reflects our minimal data practices.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>RemindMeBro does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers or any third parties. All data you input into the app, such as names and location-based reminders, is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to us or any external parties. This includes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Names and Reminders:</strong> Any names or reminder details you enter are saved only on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Location data used for setting reminders is accessed only with your permission and is stored locally on your device. We do not access, collect, or store your location data.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since RemindMeBro does not collect or retain any personal data, we do not use your information for any purpose beyond enabling the app's functionality on your device. The app uses local storage to save and retrieve your reminders and associated location data to provide the reminder service as intended.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal data because no personal data is collected or stored by RemindMeBro outside of your device. Your data remains private and is only accessible to you on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data entered into RemindMeBro is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is not stored on any external servers. The security of your data is dependent on the security of your device. We recommend keeping your device's operating system and security settings up to date to protect your information.</p>
        
        <h2>Access to Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>RemindMeBro may request access to the following device permissions to function properly:</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Location Services:</strong> To associate reminders with specific locations, the app requires access to your device's location services. You can choose to allow or deny this permission. Location data is stored only locally and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>You can manage these permissions through your device's settings at any time.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>RemindMeBro is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the app does not collect or store data externally, any use by children would involve data stored only on their device.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the app or by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed.</p>
        
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or RemindMeBro's practices, please contact us at:</p>
        
        <div class="contact-info">

            <p>You may also contact Apple Support for issues related to App Store Connect or app usage.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Compliance with App Store Requirements</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy complies with Apple's App Store guidelines, ensuring transparency about our data practices. Since RemindMeBro does not collect or process personal data beyond local device storage, no additional data privacy frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) apply to external data processing.</p>
